# ASPL Fusion Achieves Key Technical Milestone in Plasma Confinement

**New Delhi, July 22, 2025** - ASPL Fusion has announced a significant technical milestone in its fusion energy development program, achieving unprecedented plasma stability in its laboratory-scale Advanced Magnetic Mirror (AMM) device.

The experiment demonstrated stable plasma confinement for over 100 milliseconds - representing an order of magnitude improvement over previous mirror machine results and validating the company's innovative approach to fusion energy.

## Breaking Through Traditional Limitations

Mirror machines, which use magnetic fields to confine plasma in a straight configuration rather than a toroidal shape like tokamaks, have historically been limited by plasma instabilities and end losses. ASPL Fusion's technical innovations address these challenges through several proprietary improvements.

"Our team has developed a novel approach to plasma stabilization that fundamentally changes what's possible with mirror machines," explained Dr. Priya Narang, Chief Scientific Officer at ASPL Fusion. "This milestone validates our core technical hypothesis and gives us confidence in our development roadmap."

The achievement comes after months of iterative experiments and simulations conducted at the company's New Delhi laboratory facility.

## Technical Details

The experiment utilized several key innovations:

1. Optimized magnetic field geometry with enhanced end plugs
2. Precisely tuned radio frequency heating to maintain plasma stability
3. Advanced diagnostics providing real-time feedback for system control
4. Machine-learning algorithms to optimize operating parameters

"What makes this result particularly exciting is that it was achieved on a relatively modest experimental platform," said Dr. Rajiv Mehta, Lead Experimental Physicist. "The physics demonstrated here scales favorably as we move toward larger systems."

## Implications for the Development Roadmap

The successful demonstration keeps ASPL Fusion on track for its planned Phase 2 development, which will focus on high-temperature plasma experiments for industrial heat applications.

"While we're still years away from fusion energy production, this result validates a key element of our phased approach," noted Dr. Amrita Sharma, Founder and CEO. "Each technical milestone we achieve reduces risk and brings us closer to our ultimate goal of clean, abundant fusion energy for India."

The company plans to publish detailed results from the experiments in a peer-reviewed journal later this year, while protecting key intellectual property through patents.

## About ASPL Fusion's Technology

ASPL Fusion is developing an Advanced Magnetic Mirror approach to fusion energy that offers several advantages over conventional approaches:

- Simpler engineering with linear rather than toroidal geometry
- Continuous rather than pulsed operation
- Multiple revenue-generating applications at different plasma parameters
- Scalable, modular design that can be deployed incrementally

The company's pragmatic, phased strategy begins with medical isotope production, progresses through industrial heat applications, and ultimately aims to deliver grid-scale fusion power.
