# ASPL Fusion Secures Series A Funding to Commercialize Fusion Energy in India

**New Delhi, August 15, 2025** - ASPL Fusion, India's pioneering fusion energy company, today announced the successful completion of its Series A funding round, raising $20 million from a consortium of strategic investors led by Reliance New Energy and including participation from the Strategic Technology Innovation Fund (STIF).

The funding will enable ASPL Fusion to build India's first domestic medical isotope production facility based on accelerator technology, addressing a critical healthcare supply chain vulnerability while generating early revenue to support the company's fusion energy research and development program.

## A Milestone for Indian Energy Innovation

"This investment represents a significant vote of confidence in our phased approach to commercializing fusion energy," said Dr. Amrita Sharma, Founder and CEO of ASPL Fusion. "By focusing on near-term revenue opportunities like medical isotope production, we can build a sustainable business while methodically advancing our core fusion technology."

The company's innovative Advanced Magnetic Mirror approach offers a pragmatic path to fusion energy, with multiple revenue-generating applications along the way, from medical isotopes to industrial heat and hydrogen production, before ultimately delivering grid-scale fusion power.

## Addressing Critical National Needs

India currently imports 100% of its medical isotopes, creating vulnerabilities in the healthcare system and limiting access to advanced diagnostic procedures. ASPL Fusion's Phase 1 facility will produce Molybdenum-99, the parent isotope for Technetium-99m, which is used in over 40 million medical procedures worldwide each year.

"Medical isotope production is not just a stepping stone to fusion energy; it's a strategically important capability for India's healthcare sovereignty," said Dr. Priya Narang, Chief Scientific Officer at ASPL Fusion. "By establishing domestic production, we can ensure reliable supply for hospitals across India while significantly reducing costs."

## Strategic Investor Support

The funding round brings valuable strategic partners to support ASPL Fusion's ambitious roadmap.

"Fusion energy represents the ultimate clean energy technology, and ASPL Fusion's pragmatic approach gives them a credible path to commercialization," said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries. "We're proud to support indigenous innovation that addresses both immediate national needs and long-term energy security."

The company plans to break ground on its medical isotope facility in Q4 2025, with production expected to begin in late 2026.
