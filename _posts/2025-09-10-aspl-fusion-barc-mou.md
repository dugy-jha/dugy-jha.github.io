# ASPL Fusion and BARC Sign MoU for Medical Isotope Research Collaboration

**Mumbai, September 10, 2025** - ASPL Fusion has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) to collaborate on research and development of accelerator-based medical isotope production technologies.

The partnership will focus on optimizing production methods for critical medical isotopes including Molybdenum-99, Iodine-131, and Lutetium-177, which are essential for cancer diagnosis and treatment across India.

## Strengthening Domestic Capabilities

The collaboration builds on ASPL Fusion's recently announced plan to establish India's first commercial accelerator-based isotope production facility and will leverage BARC's extensive experience in nuclear medicine and radioisotope applications.

"This partnership combines BARC's decades of expertise in nuclear science with ASPL Fusion's innovative approach to isotope production," said Dr. Anil Kumar, Director of BARC. "Together, we aim to establish India as a leader in medical isotope technology and secure our healthcare infrastructure."

## Research Focus Areas

The initial phase of collaboration will include:

1. Joint research on optimizing target designs for LEU-based Mo-99 production
2. Development of improved separation and purification processes
3. Training and knowledge exchange between scientific teams
4. Exploration of novel radioisotopes for emerging therapeutic applications

Dr. Mohammed Siddiqui, Lead of Isotope Systems at ASPL Fusion, commented: "This collaboration with BARC significantly accelerates our development timeline. Their unparalleled expertise in radiochemistry and radiopharmaceuticals will be invaluable as we work to establish domestic isotope production capabilities."

## Strategic National Importance

Beyond addressing healthcare needs, the partnership has strategic importance for India's scientific and technological self-reliance.

"Medical isotope production is a perfect example of how advanced nuclear technologies directly impact everyday healthcare," said Dr. Priya Narang, Chief Scientific Officer at ASPL Fusion. "This collaboration with BARC demonstrates how public-private partnerships can accelerate innovation in areas of national importance."

The first joint research projects are expected to begin in October 2025, with initial results anticipated by early 2026.
