# ASPL Fusion to Present at International Fusion Energy Conference 2025

**New Delhi, September 25, 2025** - ASPL Fusion has been selected to present its innovative Advanced Magnetic Mirror (AMM) fusion approach at the prestigious International Fusion Energy Conference (IFEC) in Tokyo, Japan on October 15-18, 2025.

The conference, organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), brings together the world's leading fusion researchers and companies to share the latest advances in fusion science and technology.

## Showcasing India's Fusion Innovation

ASPL Fusion will deliver a presentation titled "A Pragmatic Pathway to Commercial Fusion Energy: The Advanced Magnetic Mirror Approach," highlighting the company's unique phased commercialization strategy and recent technical milestones.

"We're honored to represent Indian innovation on this global stage," said Dr. Amrita Sharma, Founder and CEO of ASPL Fusion, who will lead the presentation. "While much of the fusion world focuses on tokamaks and inertial confinement, our Advanced Magnetic Mirror approach offers distinct advantages for rapid commercialization and scaling."

The presentation will showcase recent progress in ASPL Fusion's plasma confinement experiments, which have demonstrated significantly improved stability compared to traditional mirror machines.

## Technical Breakthroughs to Be Presented

The ASPL Fusion team will present several technical innovations, including:

1. Novel end-plug designs that reduce electron losses by over 60% compared to traditional magnetic mirrors
2. Advanced RF heating systems optimized for mirror geometry
3. Innovative target designs for medical isotope production using the same core technology
4. Computer simulations showing pathways to net energy gain

"Our approach builds on decades of mirror machine research but incorporates critical innovations that address the traditional limitations of open-ended systems," explained Dr. Priya Narang, Chief Scientific Officer at ASPL Fusion. "We're excited to share these advances with the international fusion community and receive their feedback."

## Growing Global Recognition

The invitation to present at IFEC represents growing international recognition of ASPL Fusion's unique approach.

"The fusion energy landscape is rapidly evolving, with private companies driving innovation alongside government programs," noted Dr. Mohammed Siddiqui, who heads the company's simulation team. "Our selection to present at IFEC validates that India is emerging as an important player in the global fusion race."

In addition to the technical presentation, the ASPL Fusion team will participate in panel discussions on commercialization strategies for fusion energy and opportunities for international collaboration.
